            <h2>Standard ATX Motherboard</h2>
            <p>
               An IT practitioner needs to understand all the components of a motherboard, which houses many distinct electronic components. 
               We start with the motherboard as it highlights the criticality and importance of the motherboard in the world of computers. 
               As a printed circuit board, the motherboard is the most essential component in computers, enabling communication between various components. 
               In the image, you can see key parts of the motherboard such as the CPU housing, RAM slots, video card slots, and various other components. 
               The motherboard shown here is a standard ATX motherboard.

         <h2>Micro ATX Motherboard</h2>
         <p>
            The Micro ATX motherboard is designed for the principal purpose of fitting into compact builds. 
            This approach is a greener solution; however, it sacrifices the quantity of memory slots, circuit board headers, and expansion slots/components. 
            While Micro ATX motherboards can fit into full-sized cases, it is crucial to monitor the performance of the power supply wattage when adding extra peripherals. 
            Standard builds with Micro ATX motherboards typically include lower wattage power supplies.

               The circuitry, which is the chip composition, gives components and peripherals interfaces, and orders how the motherboard will talk with peripherals connected to the computer. 
               These parts generally come with a model number. Chipsets tend to operate correctly with specific parts given by the manufacturer. 
               Chipsets can be comprised of more than one chip and can be divided into two critical operating teams, Northbridge and Southbridge.

            <p>
               Different types of expansion slots appear different but also operate in various manners.
               <br><br>
               <b>PCI Expansion Slots</b>
               “Peripheral Component Interconnect” slots typically measure three inches long. An older technology but imprinted enough in the industry that it is worth learning and mentioning. 
               These buses for the PCI expansion operate at 33 and 66 Megahertz over 32-bit channels and also come in 3.3v and 5v.
               <br><br>
               <b>PCI-X Expansion Slots</b>
               PCI-Extended takes the 66 Megahertz to a new level. Introducing two different versions, PCI-X version one provided 66(533Mbps) Megahertz and 133(1066mbps) Megahertz.
               While version two supports 266 Megahertz (2133Mbps).
               <br><br>
               <b>PCIe Expansion Slots</b>
               The PCIe expansion slot is the modern technology as of 2025. 
               The modern slot achieves higher data rates by using a switch component with dot-to-dot connector slots. 
               This gives each component complete bandwidth and produces a more complex topology than a bus.
               A link is a single lane or total accumulation of lanes that the switch interconnects between devices. 
               A lane is the switched dot-to-dot signal path between two components. 
               Every lane that the switch connects creates a singular pair of wires for multi-directional flows of traffic.
               Each pairing demands a negotiation for the top mutually supported number of lanes. 
               Seven different link widths are supported, x2, x4, x8, x12, x16, and x32. Each numerical value of an ‘x’ represents the total number of available lanes provided. 
               The bridge provides communication among the adapters. Multiple PCIe expansion slots can be utilized at the same time creating a more powerful video output with (SLI) motherboards.

               Metal pins at the bottom of the memory slot keep the component securely seated in its home. The appearance of the memory modules is similar however the notches vary.
               Easily identifiable on the motherboard and may come in a variety of colors. Some RAM, however, may be color-coded to guide the installer for proper seating. 
               If there is not enough memory on the device, an “out of memory” message may occur corresponding to application failure. 
               It is possible to utilize the hard drive space for RAM. Space on a hard drive is a <i> swap file/paging file</i> or as most people know it “virtual memory”. 
               Microsoft Systems contain PAGEFILE.SYS allows the RAM to be dumped and the hard drive can transmit extra space, however, dramatic speed reductions are to be expected.
            </p>
            <b> Cache Memory </b>
            <p>
               Static RAM can be molded into cache memory between the processor and random access memory. 
               This improves the speed and performance of the machine. 
               Information is predicted by the processor and drafted in advance. 
               Cache not on the CPU is known as external cache and is known as level 2 cache. 
               Level 1 cache is internal and exists on the CPU. The location is known as <i>die/core</i>.
               The cache levels rise upon the furthering distance from the CPU. 
               For instance, the level 2 cache is away from the processor however SSD, HHD, and storage devices are considered cache 3 memory.

               (PGA) is the pin grid array, a proper name for the housing of the actual hardware. 
               Rows of fragile pins arrange themselves almost like a grid or an (LGA) land grid array, which places fragile pins on cheaper motherboards instead of a pricier CPU. 
               Although fragile a certain amount of pressure and force are required to put in place a CPU and contain locking mechanisms.

            <h2> BIOS </h2>
            <p>
               BIOS refers to the software installed on a chip on the motherboard. 
               This software contributes to the operating system's operations by allowing it to connect with other hardware in the device. 
               If the BIOS chip is unidentifiable, then the installation may be integrated into the Southbridge. 
               Inside the BIOS configuration users can find that they can monitor various amounts of resources such as temperatures of components, speed of fans, voltages, bus speeds, and other interesting analytics. 
               The BIOS can set two passwords, one for users and another for supervision. 
               The security potential of the BIOS exceeds passwords and dives into features such as sensors that can sound an alarm when the case cover is removed even with the system not connected to power or a USB flash drive that acts as a key to unlock the computer. 
               This is a process known as sealing and is achieved by using BIOS with a trusted platform module, which is a crypto-processor. 
               Microsoft can encrypt entire drives by targeting operating system files using TPM. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) extends modules to the BIOS, and can also help with security by checking boot files for tampering, known as a secure boot.

         <h2> Processor purpose and characteristics </h2>
         <p>
            The two largest CPU manufacturers are Intel and AMD. The CPU uses internal and external buses to direct and control all activities of the computer. Older CPUs had 20 pins and were rectangular shapes while modern CPUs are square and follow the pin grid array. Often colored silver and containing a printed manufacturing logo on the surface, the CPU is easily identifiable on a motherboard.
         </p>
         <h2> Hyperthreading</h2>
         <p>
            (HTT) Hyperthreading is a technology created by Intel that helps a computer's processor (CPU) work more efficiently. Normally, each core in the CPU can handle one task at a time, like playing a video or running a program. With hyperthreading, each core is "split" into two virtual cores (called threads). These virtual cores allow the CPU to handle two tasks at the same time, making it seem like you have more cores than you do. It doesn’t double the CPU's power, but it helps use the existing cores more efficiently, especially when running multiple programs or performing tasks like video editing or gaming. In short, without hyperthreading, each core does one thing at a time. With hyperthreading, each core can juggle two things at once, speeding up multitasking
         </p>
         <h2> Multicore</h2>
         <p>
            Multicore means having multiple physical cores (or processing units) inside a single processor (CPU). Each core can handle its tasks independently, which improves the computer's ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time (multitasking) or handle complex programs more efficiently. While hyperthreading improves efficiency within a core, multicore adds more cores, so the CPU has more physical workers to share the load. Many CPUs combine both technologies for maximum performance.
         </p>
         <h2> Throttling</h2>
         <p>
            Throttling is the practice of tuning the frequency of the processor to adjust the usage of power. This is necessary in devices such as cell phones where heavy applications can produce ample amounts of heat and battery drainage. When the processor does not require the excess stress to run applications, it will throttle down reducing power consumption after adjusting frequencies.
         </p>
         <h2>Speed</h2>
         <p>
            The speed of a processor, often referred to as its clock speed, is a measure of how quickly a CPU can execute instructions, typically represented in gigahertz (GHz). The higher the frequency the better the performance in the CPU. Cores, architecture efficiency, and cache size also play into the performance. 
         </p>
         <h2> 32 bit and 64 bit CPUs</h2>
         <p>
            32-bit and 64-bit processors refer to the width of the CPU's registers, which determines how much data the processor can handle at once. A 32-bit processor can process 32 bits of data at a time, while a 64-bit processor can handle 64 bits.
         </p>
         <h2> Virtualization Support </h2>
         <p>
            Virtualization support in processors refers to the ability of a CPU to run multiple operating systems or virtual machines simultaneously, with each one functioning as if it were a separate physical machine.
         </p>
         <h2> Integrated GPU</h2>
         <p>
            An integrated GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a graphics processor that is built directly into the same chip as the CPU, rather than being a separate, dedicated piece of hardware. This integration allows the system to handle graphics processing tasks without the need for a discrete graphics card.
         </p>
         <h2> Disable Execute Bit</h2>
         <p>
            Disabling the execute bit prevents the processor from executing code in certain memory regions, like those used for data or the stack, enhancing security. This feature, part of technologies like Data Execution Prevention (DEP), protects against attacks like buffer overflows by blocking malicious code from running in non-executable memory areas. Disabling it can improve security, but may interfere with some applications that require executable regions for legitimate purposes.

            Parity checking is a simple error detection method used in computer memory and communication systems that does not correct errors. It involves adding a single parity bit to each byte of data to ensure the total number of 1s is either even (even parity) or odd (odd parity), depending on the scheme. Mark and space parity use fixed bit values (1 or 0, respectively) without calculating parity. When data is read or transmitted, the parity is checked, and if it does not match, an error is detected. However, parity checking cannot identify or correct the error, and errors affecting multiple bits may go unnoticed. While early computers relied heavily on parity-based memory, advancements in memory quality have made parity checking less common in modern systems. Despite its limitations, it remains useful for detecting major memory or data transmission failures in specific contexts, though errors can still cause system crashes and require memory replacement.
            </p>
            <h2>Error-Correcting Code (ECC) </h2>
            <p>
               ECC is a more advanced method of error detection and correction used in computer memory and data transmission. It can detect and correct single-bit errors and detect larger errors. ECC adds redundant data, known as error-correcting bits, to the original data, allowing the system to identify and fix errors without requiring retransmission. This makes ECC crucial in systems where data integrity is critical, such as servers and high-performance computing.
            </p>
            <h2>Single- and Double-Sided Memory </h2>
            <p>
               Single-sided memory has memory chips on only one side of the module, while double-sided memory has chips on both sides. Double-sided memory can hold more data but may require specific motherboard support, as it behaves like two separate memory modules in some cases.
            </p>
            <h2>Single-, Dual-, and Triple-Channel Memory</h2>
            <p>
               These terms refer to how memory modules are accessed by the memory controller.
            </p>
            <h2>Single Channel </h2>
            <p>
               uses one memory module at a time, providing limited bandwidth.
            </p>
            <h2>Dual Channel</h2>
            <p>
               accesses two modules simultaneously, doubling the data transfer rate and improving performance.
            </p>
            <h2>Triple Channel </h2>
            <p>
               operates similarly but with three modules, further increasing bandwidth, provided the motherboard supports it.
            </p>
            <h2>Buffered and Unbuffered Memory</h2>
            <p>
               Buffered (or registered) memory includes an additional register between the memory controller and the module, reducing electrical load and improving stability, especially in servers. Unbuffered memory lacks this register, offering faster performance but is less stable under heavy loads and is commonly used in consumer systems.
            </p>
            <h2>ECC: Error-correcting code (ECC)</h2>
            <p>
               is an advanced memory error detection and correction method. ECC generates and stores check bits alongside data and uses an algorithm to verify data integrity during memory access. If the algorithm produces all zeros, the data is considered valid. ECC can detect both single- and double-bit errors and can correct single-bit errors. For example, if a byte contains errors in two bits, ECC can identify the issue, and if only one bit is incorrect, it can automatically correct it.
            </p>
            <h2>Single- and double-sided memory </h2>
            <p>
               refers to whether memory modules have chips on one side or both sides. Double-sided memory functions like two separate memory modules, requiring the memory controller to switch between sides, accessing only one side at a time. This design allows for higher memory capacity in less physical space compared to single-sided memory, which does not require controller switching.
            </p>
            <h2>Single-, dual-, and triple-channel memory</h2>
            <p>
               configurations are designed to improve data transfer between the CPU and RAM. Single-channel memory uses a single 64-bit data path, often creating a bottleneck. Dual-channel memory coordinates two memory banks to double the bandwidth, while triple-channel memory involves three modules and increases performance further by allowing more data access at a time. Triple-channel memory also uses interleaving, which distributes data across modules, although it transfers less information per module than dual-channel memory. Modern processors typically have 64-bit external data buses, requiring pairs or triads of memory modules for dual- and triple-channel configurations. The motherboard, not the memory, determines the channel configuration, with color-coded slots indicating which modules should be installed together for dual- or triple-channel operation. It’s crucial to install compatible memory modules, as mismatched modules may cause system issues.
            </p>
            <h2>Buffered and unbuffered memory</h2>
            <p>
               Differs in the presence of a buffer or register between the memory chips and the memory controller. A buffer acts as temporary storage to reduce the load on the primary circuit. In unbuffered memory (UDIMMs), there is no such buffer, meaning the memory controller communicates directly with the memory chips. This is common in systems that don't require the higher stability and memory support found in more complex environments.
               Buffered or registered memory (RDIMMs) includes a register that acts as a buffer, reducing the electrical load on the memory controller. This allows the system to support more memory modules while maintaining stability. Load-reduced DIMMs (LRDIMMs) are a variation of RDIMMs that improve performance by maintaining parallel communication rather than converting between serial and parallel. UDIMMs and RDIMMs can be ECC (error-correcting code), although ECC is typically associated with UDIMMs in common industry naming conventions.
            </p>
            <h2> Memory Types </h2>
            <p>
               Memory comes in various formats, each suited for specific applications based on features, characteristics, cost, and marketability. Some of the main types include:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory):</li>
               <li>ADR: Asynchronous DRAM</li>
               <li>FPM DRAM: Fast Page Mode DRAM</li>
               <li>EDO DRAM: Extended Data Out DRAM</li>
               <li>BEDO DRAM: Burst EDO DRAM</li>
               <li>SDRAM: Synchronous DRAM, a faster type synchronized with the system clock</li>
               <li>SD SDRAM: Single Data Rate SDRAM</li>
               <li>DDR SDRAM: Double Data Rate SDRAM</li>
               <li>DDR2, DDR3 SDRAM: Improved versions of DDR with faster speeds and efficiency</li>
               <li>SRAM (Static Random Access Memory): Faster and more reliable than DRAM, but more expensive and used in applications needing high-speed access</li>
               <li>ROM (Read-Only Memory): Non-volatile memory that stores data permanently, typically used for firmware</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               When choosing memory types, the selection is often influenced by the application requirements and affordability. Some types of memory can be packaged in different formats, but certain packaging types are typically associated with specific memory types. For compatibility, most motherboard manufacturers provide documentation outlining supported memory modules and configurations.
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Memory Slot Considerations: Slower memory is typically installed in lower-numbered slots, and the motherboard might require installing larger capacity modules in these slots for optimal system recognition.</li>
               <li>Capacity and Module Recognition: Some systems might not recognize high-capacity memory modules if they weren't available when the motherboard's chipset was released. A BIOS update might be needed in such cases.</li>
               <li>Double-Sided vs. Single-Sided Modules: A double-sided module acts as two separate modules, so a motherboard that supports four slots may only recognize two double-sided modules (four virtual modules). If too many modules are installed, the motherboard might not recognize them all.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               Always consult motherboard documentation for memory compatibility, configuration, and slot arrangement when installing memory.
            </p>
             <h2>DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)</h2> 
            <p>
               is the most common type of memory used in computers, often simply referred to as RAM. It's favored for its affordability because it is cheaper to manufacture than other memory types, due to its simpler design. However, DRAM requires a constant refresh signal to maintain the data stored within it. Without this refresh, the information in the memory would fade away.
            </p>
            <h2>Asynchronous DRAM </h2>
            <p>
               (ADRAM) operates independently of the CPU’s external clock. The memory chips have codes that indicate their access time, which is the time difference between when information is requested and when it is returned. Access times for ADRAM typically ranged from 40 to 120 nanoseconds, with lower access times offering better performance. Since ADRAM is not synchronized with the frontside bus, it required wait states to allow a faster CPU to work with slower memory. Common types of ADRAM include fast page mode (FPM), extended data out (EDO), and burst EDO (BEDO), though these are now largely obsolete. Today, the focus for technicians should be on synchronous forms of RAM.
            </p>
            <h2>Synchronous DRAM</h2>
            <p>
               (SDRAM) uses a common clock signal shared with the computer’s system-bus clock. This synchronizes the memory with the speed of the frontside bus (FSB) and processor, eliminating the need for the CPU to wait for memory. Initially, SDRAM referred to the only form of synchronous DRAM. As the technology evolved, new forms of SDRAM were developed, leading to the term "single data rate SDRAM" (SDR SDRAM) being used for the original type.
            </p>
            <h2>SDR SDRAM </h2>
            <p>
               is considered outdated, primarily included here to set the stage for discussing newer RAM technologies like DDR. With SDR SDRAM, each clock cycle allows for the transmission of 1 bit of data per data pin, which limits its data rate to the clock frequency. For instance, a 100MHz clock would result in a data rate of 800MBps (megabytes per second). Memory modules that rely on this technology are labeled PC100, which corresponds to the clock speed. Variants like PC66 and PC133 are also part of this family, with PC133 supporting a 133MHz clock and offering a throughput of 1066MBps. The throughput in megabytes per second is calculated by multiplying the clock speed rating by eight, reflecting the 8-byte system data bus. Using dual-channel memory can further double this throughput.
            </p>
            <h2>DDR SDRAM</h2>
            <p>
               enhances the transfer rate of regular SDRAM by transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal, effectively doubling the transfer rate without increasing the clock speed. This means that a 100MHz clock for DDR SDRAM appears as a 200MHz clock compared to SDR SDRAM. To simplify marketing and comparisons, the industry uses this "effective" clock rate when naming DDR products, which results in higher advertised speeds. For example, a 100MHz clock with double-pumping is marketed as having an FSB of 200MHz, yielding a throughput of 1600MBps, and the module is referred to as PC1600.
               The industry uses this method to label memory modules based on throughput rather than the actual clock speed. For example, a motherboard with a 400MHz FSB requires DDR400 chips, which are marketed as PC3200 modules. Similarly, a motherboard with a 333MHz FSB uses DDR333 chips, which are often sold as PC2700 modules. While the marketing labels might not always match the precise numbers, they generally reflect the same throughput, so the distinction is mostly about branding.
            </p>
            <h2>DDR2 SDRAM</h2>
            <p>
               builds upon DDR technology with several improvements, including a lower voltage of 1.8V (compared to DDR's 2.5V), which helps reduce power consumption. Like DDR, DDR2 also uses double-pumping, transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. However, DDR2 takes it further by splitting each clock pulse into two, doubling the number of operations per cycle. This results in DDR2 offering up to four times the throughput of regular SDR SDRAM.
               For example, with a 100MHz actual clock, DDR2 transfers data in four operations per cycle (equivalent to an effective 400MHz FSB), with 8 bytes per operation, resulting in a throughput of 3200MBps. DDR2 chips are named based on the perceived frequency, such as DDR2-400, while modules are labeled PC2-3200 (the "PC2" differentiates them from DDR). In cases where an FSB speed is 667MHz, the modules may be labeled as PC2-5300, even though their effective throughput is the same as the higher number (5333MBps) due to marketing preferences.
            </p>
           <h2> DDR3 </h2>
            <p>
               is the successor to DDR2 and offers improvements such as doubling the performance of DDR2 while maintaining the same system clock speed. DDR3 was designed with lower power consumption in mind, with a peak voltage of 1.5V, which is lower than DDR2’s 2.5V. DDR3 continues the double-pumping technique and executes four operations per clock wave, achieving up to eight operations per cycle. As a result, DDR3 systems commonly have FSB speeds ranging from 1066MHz to over 2000MHz.DDR3 memory modules follow the same naming convention as previous DDR generations. For example, if a motherboard has a 1600MHz FSB, you would need DDR3-1600 chips and modules named PC3-12800, offering 12800MBps throughput. The earliest DDR3 chips, based on a 100MHz actual clock signal, are paired with modules like PC3-6400, supporting 6400MBps throughput with DDR3-800 chips. The naming system ensures that the FSB speed directly correlates to the chip designation and module throughput.
            </p>
           <h2> SRAM</h2>
            <p>
               (Static Random Access Memory) does not require refreshing like DRAM, making it faster but more expensive due to its more complex design. While DRAM has access times of 40ns or more, SRAM provides much faster access times, typically under 10ns. SRAM is commonly used in cache memory due to its speed.
            </p>
          <h2>  ROM </h2>
            <p>
               (Read-Only Memory) is a type of memory that, as the name suggests, is typically not writable. Once information is etched into the ROM chip during manufacturing, it cannot be altered. ROM is commonly used to store data that doesn’t change often, such as a computer’s BIOS. The original IBM PC’s ROM contained critical functions like the power-on self-test (POST), BIOS, and cassette BASIC. Over time, different types of ROM were developed. The first was PROM (Programmable ROM), which could be written to once in the field using a special device but couldn't be altered afterward, much like burning a CD-R. Next came EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM), which could be erased with ultraviolet light and reprogrammed. Today, flash memory, which is a form of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM), is commonly used. Flash memory can be erased and rewritten with an electrical pulse instead of UV light. Despite the technological differences, all these ROM types can be used to manufacture BIOS chips, and they are all generally referred to as ROM chips.
            </p>
           <h2> Memory packaging </h2>
            <p>
               refers to the physical form and layout of memory modules, which must match the motherboard's design and supported form factors. The memory speed must also align with the motherboard's frontside bus (FSB) or CPU’s QPI. For example, if a motherboard's FSB supports speeds up to 1333MHz but the installed memory is rated at 1066MHz, the memory will only operate at 1066MHz, potentially underutilizing the system's performance. Most motherboard manufacturers list supported memory types, speeds, and pairing requirements.
               Common memory module form factors today are: 
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module): Used for desktop computers.</li>
               <li>SODIMM (Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module): Typically used in laptops and smaller devices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               The CPU or Northbridge typically supports only one specific form factor. For example, Intel Pentium 4 processors commonly used DIMMs, while laptops and compact devices require the smaller SODIMMs. Hence, both memory speed and form factor must be compatible for optimal performance.
            </p>
          <h2>  DIMM </h2>
            <p>
               (Dual Inline Memory Module) is a type of memory package used primarily for SDRAM, including SDR, DDR, DDR2, and DDR3. Unlike its predecessor, the SIMM (Single Inline Memory Module), a DIMM has independent pins on both sides of the module, allowing for greater functionality and data transfer. DIMMs are 64-bit modules and vary in the number of pins depending on the type: DIMMs allow for greater memory capacities and faster performance compared to older SIMMs, and they are used across different generations of SDRAM.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>SDR DIMM: 168 pins with 84 pins on each side.</li>
            <li>DDR DIMM: 184 pins with a single keying notch.</li>
            <li>DDR2 DIMM: 240 pins, a single keying notch, and often includes a heat spreader for heat dissipation.</li>
            <li>DDR3 DIMM: Similar to DDR2 in terms of the number of pins and keying notch, but the notch is positioned differently to prevent cross-insertion. DDR3 is both physically and electrically incompatible with DDR2 DIMM slots.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> SODIMM </h2>
            <p> 
               (Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module) is a compact memory form factor used in notebook computers and other devices with space constraints. SODIMMs come in various configurations, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Older 32-bit SODIMMs: 72-pin and 100-pin versions.</li>
            <li>Newer 64-bit SODIMMs: 144-pin SDR SDRAM, 200-pin DDR/DDR2, and 204-pin DDR3 configurations.</li>
			</ul>
            <p>
               All 64-bit SODIMMs have a single keying notch, with the 144-pin version having the notch slightly off-center. While the 200-pin DDR and DDR2 SODIMMs share similar keying notches, they are not interchangeable, and attention is required to distinguish between the two. SODIMMs are smaller than standard DIMMs and provide a space-efficient solution for portable and compact devices.
