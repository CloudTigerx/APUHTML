         Storage Devices and Power Supplies 
         </h1>
         <h2>Hard drives</h2>
         <p>
            Hard disk drives (HDD) are used for storage and quickly accessing content. Hard drives normally reside inside the computer where they are mounted for future removal with no external access. Three critical pieces make up an HDD: controllers, hard disk, and the host bus adapter.
                  </p>
				  <ul>
            <li><b>Controllers</b> Well known as SATA. This component controls how the drive functions and how data is encoded on the platters. It controls how data sends and receives signals from the motors and sensors. Most HDD devices include this part in the assembly. </li>
            <li><b>Hard Disk</b> 1-5 inch platters stacked together to store information on small disks.</li>
            <li><b>Host Bus Adapter</b>The translator, converting signals from the controller to information the pc can comprehend. Most motherboards have a HBA already, this offers headers for drive cable connections.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2> Anatomy of a Hard Drive </h2>
         <p> A hard drive is assembled in a cleanroom environment to prevent contaminants from entering the hermetically sealed casing. Once sealed, manufacturers typically place a sticker over one or more screws, warning that removing or damaging the seal will void the warranty. Even the smallest contaminants can compromise the precision components inside the hard drive. </p>
         <h2> Key Components </h2>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Platters</b></li>
            <li><b>Read/write heads</b></li>
            <li><b>Tracks</b></li>
            <li><b>Sectors</b></li>
            <li><b>Cylinders</b></li>
            <li><b>Clusters</b> (Allocation units)</li>
         </ul>
         <p> Inside the sealed casing, one or more platters store data, which is accessed by the read/write heads. These heads move in tandem across the surfaces of all platters. Older drives used stepper motors for head positioning, while newer drives use voice coils for smoother movement. Voice coil technology allows the circuitry to sense data location through a servo scheme, reducing data loss due to shifts in physical disc geometry.
            Newer drives undergo factory preparation, while legacy drives may require low-level formatting to identify platter flaws. This process ensures data is not written to defective areas. The preparation also defines tracks, which are concentric rings on the platters, and sectors, which are the smallest storage units on the disk. Magnetic drive sectors typically store 512 bytes of data each, with the total drive capacity determined by the number of sectors present. 
         </p>
         <h2> Hard Drive Geometry and CHS Addressing </h2>
         <p> The hard drive controller manages sector layout and communicates with the BIOS during read/write operations. However, the BIOS does not always interpret the actual geometry of a drive correctly. Since BIOS limitations restrict the number of sectors per track to 63, a translation occurs between where the BIOS believes data is stored and its actual location on the drive. </p>
         <h2> Hard drive geometry consists of: </h2>
         <ul>
            <li> Number of sectors per track </li>
            <li>  Number of read/write heads </li>
            <li>  Number of cylinders </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            These three values define the CHS (Cylinders/Heads/Sectors) addressing scheme. The number of cylinders represents the number of tracks per platter surface. When stacked, tracks with the same number across platters form a cylinder. A single read/write head serves each writable platter surface. 
         </p>
         <h2> To determine total storage capacity: </h2>
         <ol>
         <li> Multiply the number of cylinders by the number of heads to get the total number of tracks. </li>
         <li> Multiply the total tracks by the number of sectors per track to find the total number of sectors.  </li>
         <li> Multiply this by 512 bytes (since each sector holds 512 bytes) to get the total capacity in kilobytes (KB).  </li>
         <li> Divide by 1024 to convert KB to megabytes (MB) and again by 1024 to convert MB to gigabytes (GB).  </li>
		 </ol>
         <h3> For example, a drive with CHS geometry of 16383/16/63 results in: </h3>
         <ul>
            <li>  262,128 total tracks  </li>
            <li> 16,514,064 total sectors  </li>
            <li>8,257,032 KB (or 7.9 GB) capacity  </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            However, modern drives exceed the CHS scheme’s 8GB limitation. Instead, logical block addressing (LBA) is used, enabling storage capacities up to 128PB (petabytes).
         </p>
         <h2> Clusters and Storage Efficiency </h2>
         <p>
            A cluster (allocation unit) consists of multiple sectors grouped together. File systems use clusters to manage storage efficiently within defined addressable units. However, inefficiencies arise because no two files can share a cluster. Larger cluster sizes may improve performance for large files but lead to wasted space when storing smaller files.
         </p>
         <h2> For example, the NTFS file system allows: </h2>
         <ul>
            <li> A 64KB cluster size for volumes up to 256TB  </li>
            <li> A 2TB maximum size for simple and mirrored dynamic volumes  </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Larger clusters result in increased storage waste but benefit systems storing large files. For users managing large datasets, increasing cluster size can enhance performance. However, for mixed workloads with many small files, smaller clusters are preferable to maximize storage efficiency. 
         </p>
         <h2> HDD Speeds </h2>
         <p>
            As the electronics in the host bus adapter (HBA) and controller become faster, they can request data at increasingly high rates. However, if the platters maintain a constant spin speed, data can only be accessed as quickly as that rotation allows. To meet the demand for faster data access, manufacturers have increased platter speeds over successive generations. Common platter spin rates for conventional magnetic hard disk drives include:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li> <b>5400 rpm </b></li>
            <li> <b>7200 rpm </b></li>
            <li> <b>10,000 rpm </b></li>
            <li> <b>12,000 rpm </b></li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            While higher revolutions per minute (rpm) can lead to quicker data movement, not all applications benefit from this speed boost. Faster drives are usually more expensive per byte and are best reserved for scenarios that require rapid access—such as boot drives or disk-intensive applications. Conversely, lower spin rates are often preferable in laptops where heat output and battery life are significant concerns.
         </p>
         <h2> Solid-State Drives (SSDs) </h2>
         <p>
            Traditional hard drives use metal or glass platters coated with magnetic material, with read/write heads altering the magnetic orientation of each bit. In contrast, SSDs have no moving parts; they rely on solid-state memory technology similar to that used in other forms of flash storage. However, flash memory comes with a limitation: a finite number of write (and erase) cycles. Manufacturers extend SSD longevity by employing “wear leveling” algorithms that distribute write operations evenly across the device.
         </p>
         <b> SSDs offer several advantages: </b>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Faster Read Speeds: </b>Data is accessed more quickly.</li>
            <li><b>Lower Power Consumption:</b> They typically use less energy.</li>
            <li><b>Reduced Heat Generation:</b> No moving parts means less heat.</li>
            <li><b>Enhanced Durability:</b> They are more resistant to physical shocks.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Despite these benefits, SSDs are more expensive per byte, and their maximum storage capacities currently lag behind those of conventional hard drives. For instance, as of August 2015, the largest SSD available was 2TB, whereas conventional HDDs could reach up to 8TB. SSDs generally fall into two categories:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Flash-Based SSDs:</b> Use NAND memory and are typically more energy-efficient.</li>
            <li><b>DRAM-Based SSDs:</b> Utilize standard RAM modules, which can sometimes be upgraded for larger capacity but may draw similar power levels as HDDs. </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Both types are engineered to retain data across power cycles, and many SSDs incorporate a small amount of DRAM as a cache to further enhance performance.
         </p>
         <h2> Hybrid Drives </h2>
         <p>
            Hybrid drives offer a cost-effective middle ground between HDDs and SSDs by combining traditional magnetic storage with a small amount of solid-state storage. They come in two primary forms:
         </p>
         <ol>
         <li><b>Solid-State Hybrid Drives (SSHD): </b>These drives integrate NAND-based flash storage alongside conventional HDD platters, presenting a single drive to the operating system. The drive’s firmware automatically determines which data to cache in the solid-state portion for faster access. </li>
         <li><b>Dual-Drive Solutions:</b> This approach uses two separate drives—one HDD and one SSD—each with its own file system and drive letter. Users can manually designate which data resides on the SSD to benefit from the speed advantage. When both drives are of comparable size, the caching effect is maximized. </li>
        </ol>
		<p>
            Both hybrid configurations can leverage technologies like Intel’s Smart Response Technology (SRT) to identify frequently accessed or high-priority data for caching. However, note that data accessed for the first time is not accelerated until subsequent accesses occur.
         </p>
         <h2> Optical Storage Drives </h2>
         <p>
            Modern computers typically include an optical drive—whether it’s a Blu-ray Disc (BD), DVD, or the legacy CD drive. Although these devices replaced floppy drives in the late 1990s by offering higher capacities and performance, they were never intended to supplant hard disk drives. Optical discs used for data storage are produced similarly to their audio and video counterparts, with differences stemming from the encoding schemes applied to store digital information.
         </p>
         <h2> Optical Disc Formats and Capacities </h2>
         <p> Each generation of optical discs has increased in capacity: </p>
         <ul>
            <li><b>CD-ROMs: </b> Designed for long-term data storage, CD-ROMs are read-only and became popular for software distribution. The original format could hold around 650 MB, with later versions standardizing capacities of 700 MB, 800 MB, or even 900 MB. </li>
            <li><b>DVD-ROMs: </b> A standard, single-sided DVD-ROM holds 4.7GB of data. Adding another side creates a double-sided disc with a capacity of 9.4GB. When employing dual-layer technology on a single side, the available capacity is typically around 8.5GB due to additional spacing requirements between layers. With dual-layer technology applied to double-sided discs, capacities can reach roughly 17.1GB. </li>
            <li><b>BD-ROMs: </b> Blu-ray discs, which utilize a violet laser (405 nm) rather than a red one, can store data at higher densities. A single-layer Blu-ray disc (12 cm) holds 25GB, and adding a second layer doubles that capacity to 50GB. Thanks to refined optics, manufacturers have even demonstrated Blu-ray discs with more than four layers. </li>
         </ul>
         <h2> Optical Drive Data Rates </h2>
         <p> Optical drive speeds are rated based on their data transfer rates: </p>
         <ul>
            <li><b> CD-ROM Drives:</b>  Initially operated at 1X (150 KB/s), with subsequent models increasing the speed by factors (2X, 4X, etc.) until buffering and electronic advances allowed speeds up to 52X—even when the physical spin rate did not increase.</li>
            <li><b> DVD-ROM Drives:</b>  A DVD’s 1X speed is 1.4 MB/s. Therefore, a DVD drive running at 6X already surpasses the data rate of a high-speed CD drive, with 16X speeds being common on the upper end.</li>
            <li><b> Blu-ray Drives: </b> The base speed for Blu-ray is 4.5 MB/s (1X), about 3¼ times faster than a DVD’s 1X rate. Typically, Blu-ray players require at least 2X speed to handle commercial video playback properly.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2> Recordable Discs and Burners </h2>
         <p> With the rise of consumer demand, recordable optical media and compatible drives (burners) were developed: </p>
         <ul>
            <li><b> Recordable CDs: </b> Early CD-R drives allowed data to be written once by adjusting laser power to alter the disc’s crystalline structure. Later, CD-RW drives enabled multiple write/erase cycles. These burners are rated with compound figures that indicate separate speeds for writing, rewriting, and reading (e.g., 52X/32X/52X). </li>
            <li><b> Recordable DVDs: </b> DVD burners operate similarly but cater to larger data volumes. They support a range of formats, including DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD-R DL, and DVD+R DL. The “plus” formats are developed by the DVD+RW Alliance, while the “dash” formats come from the DVD Forum. Modern firmware typically accommodates all these variations, and most DVD burners display a distinct logo to indicate their recordable capabilities. 
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2> Recordable BD Formats </h2>
         <p> The Blu-ray Disc Association uses the “R” suffix to denote discs that can be recorded only once. Instead of using “RW” for rewritable, they opted for “RE” (short for re-recordable). Thus, you’ll find discs labeled as BD-R and BD-RE—with dual-layer versions available as well. Rather than creating separate logos for each type, the Association uses a single generic BD logo along with a sans-serif label that specifies the disc type. </p>
         <h2> Drive Interfaces and RAID </h2>
         <p>Storage devices now come in a variety of forms. Beyond older standards like IDE/EIDE and SCSI, modern systems use Serial ATA (SATA), and devices may be connected internally or externally. The following sections outline these storage solutions from several perspectives.</p>
         <h2>Serial ATA Drives</h2>
         <p>Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) drives once dominated the market—not only for hard drives but also for optical and tape drives. Known today as IDE PATA, this interface is now considered legacy technology. SATA evolved from the original ATA specifications by adopting serial data transmission. In contrast to parallel transmissions—which require synchronizing multiple bits simultaneously—serial transmission sends data in a single, orderly stream, making it easier to achieve higher speeds as transceiver technology advances.
         The first SATA standard, known as SATA 1.5Gbps (also called SATA I or SATA 150), employs an 8b/10b encoding scheme. This means that for every 8 bits of actual data, 2 extra bits are added for overhead, reducing the effective bandwidth by 20%. For example, dividing 1.5Gbps by 10 yields a throughput of approximately 150MBps. The original SATA specification also introduced hot swapping, allowing drives to be replaced without shutting down the system. Subsequent SATA versions—SATA 3Gbps (often referred to as SATA II or SATA 300) and SATA 6Gbps (sometimes called SATA III or SATA 600)—continue this trend, with each version doubling the throughput of the previous one.
         Modern SATA connectors use card-edge style designs for both data and power. This arrangement eliminates the need for bulky cables in desktops and servers, while also simplifying laptop designs by removing the need for protective adapters for fragile parallel interface pins. </p>
         <h2> RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) </h2>
         <p>
            RAID combines multiple physical hard disks into a single logical unit to improve performance, enhance fault tolerance, or both. RAID can be implemented in software or hardware, with hardware solutions generally offering higher performance at a higher cost. The most common RAID levels include: 
         </p>
         <ul>
         <li><b> RAID 0 (Disk Striping):</b>
            Data is split evenly across at least two drives to form a larger volume. This increases performance because one drive can read or write while another is busy. However, RAID 0 provides no redundancy—if one drive fails, all data is lost. It is best used in combination with another fault-tolerance method. 
         </li>
         <li><b> RAID 1 (Disk Mirroring):</b>
            Data is duplicated on two separate drives, ensuring that if one drive fails, the other contains an exact copy. While this provides excellent fault tolerance, it does not improve speed and requires double the storage capacity, making it more expensive. When a dedicated host adapter is used for the mirror drive, this configuration is sometimes referred to as duplexing. 
         </li>
         <li><b> RAID 5 (Striping with Distributed Parity):</b>
            This level stripes data across n–1 drives and stores parity information on the remaining drive, with the parity blocks distributed across all drives. In the event of a single drive failure, the parity data can be used to reconstruct lost information. RAID 5 requires at least three drives, and while it offers a balanced mix of performance and fault tolerance, the rebuild process after a drive failure can temporarily slow performance. The cost is effectively the capacity of one drive for redundancy, which becomes a smaller percentage of the total as more drives are added. 
         </li>
         <li><b> Other RAID configurations include RAID 6 </b>
            (which tolerates two simultaneous drive failures by using two parity blocks) and hybrid setups such as RAID 10 (or RAID 1+0) and RAID 0+1, which combine mirroring and striping for enhanced performance and redundancy. Both RAID 10 and RAID 0+1 require a minimum of four drives and sacrifice half of the total storage capacity for mirroring. 
         </li>
		 </ul>
         <h2> Removable Storage and Media </h2>
         <p>
            Modern PCs offer a wide range of storage options beyond traditional internal hard drives. In addition to advanced optical drives and external hard disks, there are various removable storage solutions—from tape backups to solid-state media like USB keys. Removable storage has evolved significantly: whereas tape backups once dominated, today’s solutions tend to be random-access and solid-state, offering faster and more flexible data management.
         </p>
         <h2> Tape Backup Devices </h2>
         <p>
            Tape backup remains one of the oldest forms of removable storage. Tape devices—whether installed internally or used as external units—rely on either digital or analog magnetic tape. They can hold vast amounts of data, though they are slower than disk-based systems, making them ideal for batch archival storage rather than interactive use. Historically favored by large enterprises for their capacity and long-term reliability, tape systems are now challenged by writable and rewritable optical discs. However, for regular, large-scale data backups, tape remains a popular choice (see Table 2.3 for a timeline of tape formats and their capacities).
         </p>
         <h2> Flash Memory </h2>
         <p>
            Flash memory, once used solely for primary memory in computers, now appears in numerous formats for both removable and non-removable storage. This technology is found in SD cards, other memory cards, and USB flash drives—all of which can store significant amounts of data in a compact form factor. Flash memory is also the foundation for SSDs and is widely used in devices like routers and switches to store boot code and critical configuration data. Many of these systems incorporate flash memory in various packaging designs to enhance portability, such as keychain-sized USB drives. 
         </p>
         <h2> SD and Other Memory Cards </h2>
         <p>
            Portable electronic devices—from digital cameras to smartphones—rely on small, removable solid-state memory cards for data storage. The Secure Digital (SD) format has emerged as the industry leader, evolving from the older MultiMediaCard (MMC) standard. Both SD and MMC cards typically measure about 32mm by 24mm, though SD cards are slightly thicker and include a write-protect notch (often with a physical switch). Smaller formats have also been developed: 
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li><b> miniSD: </b> Approximately 21.5mm by 20mm </li>
            <li><b> microSD: </b> Roughly 15mm by 11mm </li>
         </ul>
         <h2> Embedded Flash Memory </h2>
         <p>
            Embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC) technology is based on the classic MMC flash card but is permanently integrated into the main circuit board of mobile or cost-sensitive devices. With an integrated controller, an eMMC drive can serve as bootable storage. However, eMMC generally cannot match the performance of SSDs, which benefit from advanced firmware and faster interfaces (such as SATA), as well as multi-chip configurations that operate similarly to RAID arrays.
         </p>
         <h2> USB Flash Drives </h2>
         <p>
            USB flash drives are exceptionally versatile, compact storage devices that let you carry large amounts of data in a very small package. They typically extend directly from the USB port without adding significant bulk, making them easy to transport in a pocket or laptop bag. Leveraging the plug-and-play functionality of USB, these drives announce themselves immediately upon insertion—appearing in Windows File Explorer as removable drives complete with an assigned drive letter. This familiar interface supports drag-and-drop operations and most other file management functions. In some instances, if a drive fails to automatically acquire a letter (often because its previous letter is still in use), you may need to assign one manually using the Disk Management utility (discussed in Chapter 13, “Operating System Basics”). 
         </p>
         <h2> Hot-Swappable Devices </h2>
         <p>
            Many modern removable storage devices are designed to be hot swappable, meaning they can be inserted or removed while the computer remains powered on. This is typical for USB-connected devices that have an established file system. In contrast, non-hot-swappable devices require additional precautions or even a complete power shutdown before safe removal or insertion. 
         </p>
         <ul>
         <li><b>  Cold-Swappable Devices: </b> These require that the system power be off before insertion or removal. Typical examples include devices connected via PS/2-style mini-DIN connectors (like certain keyboards and mice), where insertion with power on may lead to non-recognition or even damage. </li>
         <li><b>  Warm-Swappable Devices: </b> Devices such as USB flash drives and external drives with file systems can be removed safely once the operating system signals that it is safe (for instance, after using the “Safely Remove Hardware” utility). Despite the term “warm swappable,” these devices are essentially hot swappable once properly disengaged. </li>
         </ul>
		 <p>
            Some RAID systems and associated drive bays also use a single connector design—known as Single Connector Attachment (SCA)—which combines both power and data. In such configurations, the ground leads are engineered to connect before the power leads, ensuring safe hot swapping.
         </p>
         <h1> Installing, Removing, and Configuring Storage Devices </h1>
         <h2>
         Installation and Configuration: 
         </h2>
         <p>
            Installing storage devices such as hard drives, CD/DVD drives, or tape drives is generally straightforward with today’s Plug and Play BIOS and operating systems. Once connected, most devices are automatically recognized, and minimal configuration is required. However, new hard drives typically must be partitioned and formatted before you can install an operating system. Modern operating systems simplify this process, guiding you through partitioning and setup without much hassle.
         </p>
         <h2> Removing Devices: </h2>
         <p>
            Generally, removing a storage device is simpler than installing one. Most users can safely remove a component if they have access to the case. While many might not be capable of building a system from scratch, they can often remove a drive without much difficulty.
         </p>
         <h2> Installing Devices: </h2>
         <p>
            Storage devices come in various form factors—referring to their physical dimensions. Common variations include differences in width (e.g., 3″ versus 5¼″), height (half-height vs. full-height or larger), and specialized sizes for laptops. Before installation, ensure that your chassis has an available bay that matches the device’s form factor. If the drive is smaller than the bay, adapters may be used; however, larger devices cannot be fitted into a smaller bay.
         </p>
         <h1> Power Supplies and Related Components </h1>
         <h2> Identifying Purposes and Characteristics of Power Supplies </h2>
         <p>
            A computer’s internal components depend on a reliable power supply unit (PSU) to convert 110V or 220V AC into the DC voltages required by the system—typically +3.3VDC, +5VDC, –5VDC (on older systems), +12VDC, and –12VDC. Color-coded wiring helps quickly identify these voltages, with black wires serving as the ground reference. The +3.3V supply, for instance, was introduced with ATX motherboards.
         </p>
         <h2> Dual-Rail Architecture </h2>
         <p>
            Modern PSUs often employ multiple 12V rails to distribute power more effectively. One rail might serve the CPU, while another powers the remaining components. Although this configuration can provide a greater total output, each rail has a maximum current limit. If one rail is overloaded—despite overall sufficient power—the PSU may shut down to protect itself. It is therefore crucial to balance the load across all rails.
         </p>
         <h2> Power and Voltage Ratings </h2>
         <p>
            Power supplies are rated in watts, which denote their capacity to supply power. Most desktop computers require between 250 and 500 watts, though high-performance systems with advanced graphics cards or numerous drives may need more. Beyond wattage, modern PSUs offer a variety of connectors—including standard peripheral connectors, dedicated SATA and PCIe power connectors, and sometimes modular cabling—to meet evolving hardware demands. Many units feature a voltage selector switch to adjust between international voltage standards (e.g., 110/220V, 115/230V, or 120/240V). Using the incorrect setting can result in failure to power up or, worse, severe damage.
         </p>
         <h1> Power Connectors </h1>
         <h2> Classic Power Connectors: </h2>
         <p>
            Early PCs used the AT system connectors (commonly two six-wire connectors known as P8 and P9) to supply power to the motherboard. These connectors interlock with matching receptacles on the board, and proper installation—typically aligning the ground wires together—is essential to prevent damage.
         </p>
         <h2> Modern Power Connectors: </h2>
         <p>
            While the Molex peripheral connector remains in use, modern systems have largely replaced the old AT connectors with the ATX standard. This evolution has led to several new standards: 
         </p>
         <h2> ATX, ATX12V, and EPS12V Connectors: </h2>
         <p>
            The original ATX connector (a single 20-pin connector) was later expanded (to 24-pin or 20+4 configurations) to meet the growing power demands of modern motherboards. When higher power delivery became necessary, especially with the advent of processors like the Pentium 4—supplemental connectors (such as the 6-pin auxiliary and 4-pin P4 connectors) were introduced. Later, the EPS12V standard provided an 8-pin connector for improved CPU power delivery. In addition, dedicated PCI Express power connectors (6-pin for 75W and 8-pin for 150W) have been designed with specific keying and physical features (like a bridging tab) to prevent misconnection.
         </p>
         <h2> Proprietary Power Connectors: </h2>
         <p>
            Some computer manufacturers employ proprietary connectors between the PSU and the motherboard, often to address unique design requirements or to ensure compatibility with specific hardware.
         </p>
         <h2> SATA Power Connectors: </h2>
         <p>
            SATA drives require a dedicated 15-pin power connector, which supplies multiple voltages: typically, three pins each for +3.3V, +5V, and +12V, interleaved with corresponding ground connections. These connectors follow similar color-coding schemes to legacy connectors and are specifically tailored for the power needs of SATA devices.
         </p>
         <h2> Replacing Power Supplies </h2>
         <p>
            Over time, a power supply may fail or no longer provide adequate power for an upgraded system. Replacing a PSU is generally straightforward—but it’s important to ensure that the new unit’s connectors are compatible with your motherboard. For example, a PSU with a 20-pin ATX connector might require an adapter if used with a motherboard that expects the older P8/P9 configuration. Additionally, consider the physical dimensions of the new PSU, especially when working with compact cases (smaller cases may require smaller form factor power supplies with lower wattage). (Refer to Exercise 2.3 for a step-by-step guide on PSU removal and installation.) 
         </p>
         <h2> AC Adapters as Power Supplies </h2>
         <p>
         Laptops use AC adapters to convert AC power to the DC voltages required for internal components—functionally similar to desktop PSUs. AC adapters are also rated in watts and must match both the output voltage and the connector specifications (including polarity) of the device. Since these adapters can fail over time, replacement is usually recommended over repair. When choosing an adapter, always ensure that its output voltage and physical connector (size, shape, and polarity) match the requirements of your laptop.
